Gemini Advanced / Antigravity "Agent terminated due to error" - Ultra Account Issue

## Message to Support

Hi Google One Support Team,

I'm experiencing an issue with my **Google One Ultra subscription** that's preventing me from using Gemini Advanced / Antigravity IDE properly.

### Problem Description
- **Error:** "Agent terminated due to error"
- **Frequency:** Consistent (not intermittent)
- **Affected Account:** mr.phariyawit (Ultra subscription)

### Important Comparison
I have tested with **another account** (`jiap.wannabe@gmail.com`) which has a **Pro subscription**, and it works **perfectly fine**. This suggests the issue is specific to my Ultra account, not a local machine or memory issue.

### What I've Already Tried
1. ✅ Verified local memory usage (~1.2MB) - healthy, no bloat
2. ✅ No browser_recordings folder causing issues
3. ✅ Started fresh conversations
4. ✅ Tried different model tiers (High/Standard/Low)
5. ✅ Set HTTP Compatibility Mode to HTTP/1.1

### My Questions
1. Is there any account-level issue with my Ultra subscription?
2. Is there a billing or payment problem I should be aware of?
3. Are there any known issues with Ultra tier API access currently?
4. Can you check if my account has any flags or restrictions?

### Account Details
- **Account:** mr.phariyawit@[email domain]
- **Subscription:** Google One Ultra (with Gemini Advanced)
- **IDE:** Antigravity

Thank you for your help!
